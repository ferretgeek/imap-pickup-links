# IMAP pickup links

[中文](README.md) · English

Create a separate web link for each receiving address in an existing mailbox, so recipients can view recent messages and verification codes. Disable or rotate each link independently without sharing the mailbox password.

Requirements: Windows, macOS, or Linux, Python 3.10+, SQLite 3.35+, and an IMAP-accessible mailbox with an app-specific password. Sharing requires a reachable service address; public access requires HTTPS.

## What it does

- **Independent pickup links** — a cryptographically random URL per mailbox, individually revocable or rotatable, with no cross-effect.
- **Read-only, and degrades gracefully** — queries are isolated per IMAP account group, and cached content stays readable through a temporary upstream outage.
- **A real admin UI** — account-group checks, URL management, access statistics, paging, and search, all in the browser.
- **Four global themes** — Skyline Blue, Verdant Green, Sunset Orange, and deep-gray night, switchable from the top right and remembered.
- **Safe by default** — binds `127.0.0.1`; the admin password is read from stdin (never from shell history); external IP geolocation is off.
- **Local or server** — runs locally on Windows, macOS, and Linux, or long-term under systemd on Linux.

## Getting started

Requires Python 3.10+ and SQLite 3.35+. No third-party runtime dependencies.

```powershell
python --version
python pickup_server/app.py init --admin-password-stdin --base-url "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
python pickup_server/app.py serve
```

The first command reads the admin password securely from the terminal and generates a local-only `.env` and SQLite database. Then visit:

- Admin UI: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin`
- Health: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/health`
- Readiness: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/ready`

LAN and internet access are **off** by default. Only pass `--host 0.0.0.0` if you genuinely need direct LAN access, and configure your firewall. For public deployment, keep `127.0.0.1` and let Caddy or Nginx terminate HTTPS.

## Importing mailboxes

Copy `examples/待导入邮箱/示例账号组.txt` into a private directory that **stays out of Git**. Each TXT file represents one primary-account group:

```text
owner@example.com----app-specific-password
pickup-one@example.com
pickup-two@example.com
```

Then import and generate URLs:

```powershell
python pickup_server/app.py import --source "private-mailbox-folder" --base-url "http://127.0.0.1:8080" --output "output/pickup-urls.txt"
python pickup_server/app.py audit-urls --input "output/pickup-urls.txt"
```

`audit-urls` reports format, duplicates, and counts only — it **never echoes an address or token.**

## Pickup API

```text
GET /api/q/<token>/messages?wait=5&limit=30
```

- When `fetch.pending=true`, retry according to `Retry-After` or `fetch.retry_after_seconds`.
- `fetch.state=degraded` means this refresh failed but existing cache is still readable.
- Deduplicate using each message's stable `id`.

## Worth noting technically

**Degraded reads are a deliberate design.** IMAP upstreams misbehave. When that happens the API doesn't just error — it returns `fetch.state=degraded` alongside the existing cache, **and says explicitly that it's degraded.** Someone collecting a code gets the one from ten minutes ago while knowing the data isn't fresh, which is far more useful than a 500.

**Queries are isolated per account group.** A pickup token can only reach the IMAP account group it belongs to; cross-group access is cut off at the data layer rather than filtered in the UI.

**The password comes from stdin.** `--admin-password-stdin` keeps it out of command-line arguments, and therefore out of shell history, `ps` output, and systemd journals.

**IP geolocation is off by default.** Visitor IPs are sent to a restricted HTTPS service (`ipwho.is` or `ipapi.co`) and cached only if the operator explicitly sets `PICKUP_ENABLE_IP_GEO=1`. If you don't need it, leave it off — **visitor IPs shouldn't go to a third party by default.**

**Long polling, not polling.** The `wait` parameter lets callers block for new mail instead of requesting once a second.

**Standard library only.** Server, admin UI, cache, and statistics are all implemented with the Python standard library, so deployment involves no dependency resolution at all.

Full server deployment, update, and rollback steps are in [deployment](docs/部署说明.md); the API and data model are in [technical notes](docs/技术说明.md).

## What it doesn't do

- It doesn't send, delete, or modify anything in a mailbox (read-only).
- It neither accepts nor stores your primary mailbox password — use an app-specific password.
- It provides no public entry point by default (you configure the HTTPS reverse proxy).
- No spam filtering, no mail-client features.

## Privacy boundaries

At runtime it stores mailbox configuration, app-specific passwords, pickup tokens, message cache, and access statistics. The following must **never** be committed or published:

```text
pickup_server/.env
pickup_server/data/
output/
real mailbox import files
```

The public repository has been scanned across source, history, docs, images, and metadata — but the operator still has to protect the runtime directory and use HTTPS. Report security issues privately per [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Verification

```powershell
python -m compileall -q pickup_server tests
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Release-audit findings are recorded in [docs/发布审计.md](docs/发布审计.md).
